# When you configure a variable, DO NOT leave spaces around the "=" sign.

# PPPoE user name.  You may have to supply "@provider.com"  Sympatico
# users in Canada do need to include "@sympatico.ca"
# Sympatico uses PAP authentication.  Make sure /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
# contains the right username/password combination.
# For Magma, use xxyyzz@magma.ca
#USER='haoma@cqupt'

# Bring link up on demand?  Default is to leave link up all the time.
# If you want the link to come up on demand, set DEMAND to a number indicating
# the idle time after which the link is brought down.
DEMAND=no
#DEMAND=300

# DNS type: SERVER=obtain from server; SPECIFY=use DNS1 and DNS2;
# NOCHANGE=do not adjust.
DNSTYPE=NOCHANGE

# Obtain DNS server addresses from the peer (recent versions of pppd only)
# In old config files, this used to be called USEPEERDNS.  Changed to
# PEERDNS for better Red Hat compatibility

# Make the PPPoE connection your default route.  Set to
# DEFAULTROUTE=no if you don't want this.

### ONLY TOUCH THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS IF YOU'RE AN EXPERT

# How long pppoe-start waits for a new PPP interface to appear before
# concluding something went wrong.  If you use 0, then pppoe-start
# exits immediately with a successful status and does not wait for the
# link to come up.  Time is in seconds.
#
# WARNING WARNING WARNING:
#
# If you are using rp-pppoe on a physically-inaccessible host, set
# CONNECT_TIMEOUT to 0.  This makes SURE that the machine keeps trying
# to connect forever after pppoe-start is called.  Otherwise, it will
# give out after CONNECT_TIMEOUT seconds and will not attempt to
# connect again, making it impossible to reach.
CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30

# How often in seconds pppoe-start polls to check if link is up
CONNECT_POLL=2

# Specific desired AC Name
ACNAME=

# Specific desired service name
SERVICENAME=

# Character to echo at each poll.  Use PING="" if you don't want
# anything echoed
PING="."

# File where the pppoe-connect script writes its process-ID.
# Three files are actually used:
#   $PIDFILE       contains PID of pppoe-connect script
#   $PIDFILE.pppoe contains PID of pppoe process
#   $PIDFILE.pppd  contains PID of pppd process
# CF_BASE="`basename $CONFIG`"
# PIDFILE="/var/run/$CF_BASE-pppoe.pid"

# Do you want to use synchronous PPP?  "yes" or "no".  "yes" is much
# easier on CPU usage, but may not work for you.  It is safer to use
# "no", but you may want to experiment with "yes".  "yes" is generally
# safe on Linux machines with the n_hdlc line discipline; unsafe on others.
SYNCHRONOUS=no

# Do you want to clamp the MSS?  Here's how to decide:
# - If you have only a SINGLE computer connected to the DSL modem, choose
#   "no".
# - If you have a computer acting as a gateway for a LAN, choose "1412".
#   The setting of 1412 is safe for either setup, but uses slightly more
#   CPU power.
CLAMPMSS=1412
#CLAMPMSS=no

# plugin, use LINUX_PLUGIN=/etc/ppp/plugins/rp-pppoe.so

# Any extra arguments to pass to pppoe.  Normally, use a blank string
# like this:
PPPOE_EXTRA=""

# Rumour has it that "Citizen's Communications" with a 3Com
# HomeConnect DSL Modem DualLink requires these extra options:
# PPPOE_EXTRA="-f 3c12:3c13 -S ISP"

# Any extra arguments to pass to pppd.  Normally, use a blank string
# like this:

########## DON'T CHANGE BELOW UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
# If you wish to COMPLETELY overrride the pppd invocation:
# Example:
# OVERRIDE_PPPD_COMMAND="pppd call dsl"

# If you want pppoe-connect to exit when connection drops:
RETRY_ON_FAILURE=no
